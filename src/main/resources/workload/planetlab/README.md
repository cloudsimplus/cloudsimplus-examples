# Datacenter Trace Files in the PlanetLab Format

This directory contains some workload files that can be used to create Cloudlets to simulate execution of jobs from a PlanetLab real Datacenter trace file.
These files are originated from [CloudSim](http://cloudbus.org/cloudsim).

Each sub-directory contains traces from a specific date. 
Each file contains CPU utilization percentage in scale from 0 to 100, 
measured at every 5 minutes (300 seconds) inside PlanetLab's VMs.
The [UtilizationModelPlanetLab](../../../../../../cloudsimplus/src/main/java/org/cloudsimplus/utilizationmodels/UtilizationModelPlanetLab.java) class can be used to read these values and define a CPU Utilization Model for Cloudlets. When the class loads a trace file, it converts the percentage values to a scale between 0 and 1.

In order to reduce build time and to keep the project size small, just one directory of PlanetLab traces was kept. If you want to build simulations using other traces, a fork of the original files is available 
[here](https://github.com/manoelcampos/planetlab-workload-traces).
