/**
 * An example showing a very minimal code required to create

 *
 * <p><b>NOTICE: This example is not intended to be reused and we strongly recommend
 * you not doing that. Since all the code is inside a single method,
 * that is completely unappropriated.</b></p>
 *
 * <p>This code has the <b>only intention</b> to show how it's simpler
 * and easier to create cloud computing simulations using CloudSim Plus.</p>
 *
 * <p>If you want a basic, but organized and reusable first example,
 * see the {@link BasicFirstExample}.</p>
